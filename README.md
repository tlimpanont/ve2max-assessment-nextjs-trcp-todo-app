# NextJS 14 Test Project

## Overview

This project is a test assignment to evaluate your skills and familiarity with NextJS 14, TypeScript, Prisma, TRPC, and Zustand. The application will be a full-stack application with both frontend and backend implemented within NextJS. The project is expected to take around 2 days to complete.

## Project Requirements

### 1. NextJS 14 Application

- Use NextJS 14 for both the frontend and backend.
- Implement the application using TypeScript.
- Use a SQL database (preferably PostgreSQL, but others are fine too)

### 2. Frontend

- Implement a simple user interface that interacts with the backend via TRPC.
- Use Zustand for state management.
- Ensure the UI is clean, responsive, and user-friendly.

### 3. Backend

- Implement the backend logic within NextJS using API routes.
- Use Prisma for database interactions.
- Use TRPC for type-safe API calls.

### 4. Data Model

- Design a simple data model using Prisma. For instance, a model for managing a list of tasks (to-do list) or user profiles.

### 5. Features

- Implement CRUD operations for the chosen data model.
- Ensure all CRUD operations are exposed via TRPC endpoints.
